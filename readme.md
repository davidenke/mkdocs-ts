# MkDocs to Typescript Converter

This has been thrown together in a sleepless night ðŸŒ™.

After digging into the georgeous [Scriptable app](https://scriptable.app/) I wanted to improve the developer experience by providing types for the Scriptable API. So all efforts have been a bit biased to my needs to parse the [provided documentation](https://docs.scriptable.app/scriptable.json).

## Improvements

Some missing things that would be nice once another sleepless night comes around:

- some unit tests
- using e.g. ts-morph to build the AST
- running it against some other generated docs
- typings for the mkdocs json format (is there at least some schema out there?)

## Installation

From GitHub for the time being:

```bash
npm install davidenke/mkdocs-ts
```

## Usage

`mkdocs-ts <input: file path or URL> <output: path to target file>`

```bash
npm run mkdocs-ts ./example.json example.d.ts
```

or

```bash
npm run mkdocs-ts https://some.remote/example.json example.d.ts
```
